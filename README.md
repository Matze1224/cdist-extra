# cdist-contrib

This project extends the [cdist](https://www.cdi.st/) configuration management
tool with community-maitained types which are either too specific to fit/be
maintained in cdist itself or were not accepted in code cdist but could still
be useful.

The releases of cdist-contrib are not necessarly synced with cdist itself.
